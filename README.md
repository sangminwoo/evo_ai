## Knapsack Problem

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

## Traveling Salesman Problem

The travelling salesman problem (also called the traveling salesperson problem or TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"

## 4bit Deceptive Problem

Deceptive problems are a class of challenging problems for conventional genetic algorithms (GAs), which usually mislead the search to some local optima rather than the global optimum.

## Neural Network Architecture Optimization

Optimize the NN structure in terms of minimizing the number of connections (i.e., weights or edges) among neurons by using a customized GA, while maintaining the classification accuracy as much as possible.
